  "what is the sun": "The Sun is a medium-sized star at the center of our solar system. It's a massive ball of hot plasma held together by gravity, with a core temperature of about 15 million degrees Celsius. The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium.",
  
  "how many planets": "There are 8 planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.",
  
  "what is a black hole": "A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. They form when massive stars collapse at the end of their lives.",
  
  "how big is the universe": "The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter. However, the entire universe might be infinite. We can only see a portion of it due to the finite speed of light and the age of the universe.",
  
  "what is dark matter": "Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that makes up about 27% of the universe. It doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible. We know it exists because of its gravitational effects on visible matter.",
  
  "how far is mars": "Mars is approximately 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles) away from the Sun on average. The distance between Earth and Mars varies greatly, from about 54.6 million km to 401 million km depending on their positions in orbit.",
  
  "what is the milky way": "The Milky Way is our home galaxy, containing over 100 billion stars. It's a spiral galaxy about 100,000 light-years across. Our solar system is located about 26,000 light-years from the galactic center.",
  
  "how do rockets work": "Rockets work on Newton's third law: for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. They burn fuel to create hot gases that are expelled downward, which pushes the rocket upward. They carry their own oxygen supply to work in the vacuum of space.",
  
  "what is gravity": "Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts objects with mass toward each other. According to Einstein's theory, massive objects actually curve spacetime, and this curvature is what we experience as gravity.",
  
  "how old is the universe": "The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, as determined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other astronomical measurements."
